Users can change Jenkins to fit their needs.\n\n2. People think Jenkins is great for managing tasks like continuous integration and deployment, even for big projects.\n\n3. Users love that they can customize Jenkins for their projects. Being able to adapt Jenkins is important for fitting in with how projects are developed.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Jenkins?\nJenkins may not be suitable, for beginners as it has a bit of a learning curve. Its interface appears outdated. It can be resource intensive. Security concerns have been raised by some users. Working with plugins can pose challenges at times.\n\nWhat problems is Jenkins solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAs we work in an edtech company, it helps us to log in to the client environment in a few seconds providing a secured token for one-time login.\nAdditionally, It makes updates faster and prevents panic caused by deployment issues. It helps catch problems before customers notice.",

Likable features: Jenkins pipelines, declarative pipelines, Jenkins jobs DSL.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Jenkins?\nFirst thing: it can be complex to set up and configure due to its vast options/features. It is hungry for resources, i.e. it uses a lot of resources, which can be a problem for smaller projects. There is difficulty in troubleshooting if something goes wrong in Jenkings; there is no easy way to figure it out.\n\nWhat problems is Jenkins solving and how is that benefiting you?\nMainly it automates manual tasks, such as building, testing and deploying software.

I like the way it does unit and integration tests on the code before creating a deployment package. It is very easy from Jenkins to publish snapshot/releases in to different repositories such as Nexus, AWS ECR, etc\n\nWhat do you dislike about Jenkins?\nJenkins can add a feature to not allow pipeline building without user login for security purposes. Which is the only change I want to see.\n\nWhat problems is Jenkins solving and how is that benefiting you?\nJenkins is solving the problem of releasing software by providing features to build code by doing unit and integration tests. It is very easy for jenkins to do hard versioning of the code and release the build and snapshot the next version. At the same time using an automation pipeline it also publishes the build into different repos like Nexus and AWS ECR.",
